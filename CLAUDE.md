# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this project is

Static multi-page marketing website for **Neewoody Custom Woodwork** (Accra, Ghana), with an embedded React-based crew dispatch app and Cloudflare Workers serverless functions. No build system — all files are deployed directly.

## Development

**Local preview:** Open any `.html` file directly in a browser, or use a local server:
```
npx serve .
# or
python -m http.server 8080
```

**Deployment:** Push to the `main` branch — the site deploys via Cloudflare Pages. The `functions/` directory is automatically picked up as Cloudflare Workers.

**Cloudflare Worker env vars:** The Instagram feed function (`functions/api/instagram.js`) requires `IG_TOKEN` set in the Cloudflare Pages dashboard (not in code).

## Architecture

### Pages
- **Marketing pages** (`index.html`, `pricing.html`, `portfolio.html`, category pages): standard static HTML
- **Product category pages** (`wardrobes.html`, `kitchens.html`, `beds.html`, `shelving.html`, `tv-units.html`, `solid-wood.html`, `dining-living.html`): follow the same layout pattern
- **Tools** (`wardrobe-estimator.html`, `cutlist.html`): calculator tools, vanilla JS
- **Dispatch** (`dispatch.html`): React 18 SPA loaded via unpkg CDN with Babel standalone for JSX — this is the internal crew/job management app
- **Case studies** (`projects/house-of-walker.html`, `projects/sage-centre.html`): project detail pages

### Serverless
- `functions/api/instagram.js` — Cloudflare Worker; fetches latest Instagram media and returns top 6 posts. Cached 15 minutes (`max-age=900`).

### PWA
- `sw.js` — Service Worker for Web Push notifications, used exclusively by the Dispatch app
- `manifest.json` — PWA manifest (app name: "Neewoody Dispatch")
- Push notifications open `/dispatch.html` on click

## Design system

All styling is in `/css/styles.css` using CSS custom properties. Key tokens:
- `--clr-accent`: `#A0784A` (warm wood brown — primary brand colour)
- `--clr-bg`: `#F7F4EF` (cream)
- `--clr-dark`: near-black for text
- Typography: **Playfair Display** (headings) + **DM Sans** (body), loaded from Google Fonts

Common UI patterns implemented in `/js/main.js`:
- Mobile nav toggle
- Scroll-reveal (`.reveal` class → fade-in on IntersectionObserver)
- Portfolio filter (data-filter attributes)
- FAQ accordion (single-open state)
- Instagram feed fetch from `/api/instagram`

## Key conventions

- New marketing pages should follow the existing HTML structure: same `<head>` meta/font links, nav, and footer pattern as `index.html`
- The nav includes a **Services dropdown** with tool badges for the estimator and dispatch — update it in every page when adding new pages
- Structured data (JSON-LD `LocalBusiness` schema) lives in `index.html` — update there for business info changes
- SEO files (`sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`) are hand-maintained — update `sitemap.xml` when adding new pages
- The dispatch React app uses **no bundler** — JSX is transpiled in-browser by Babel standalone; keep it self-contained within `dispatch.html`

- Table saw — GH₵15,000 replacement

### Tools & Infrastructure
**Dispatch app:** /dispatch.html — crew job management PWA
**Pricing tool:** /pricing.html — admin only, internal cost calculator with quotes
**Cutlist generator:** /cutlist.html — parametric wardrobe cutlist for carpenters
**Wardrobe estimator:** /wardrobe-estimator.html — client-facing price range tool

**Backend:**
- Cloudflare Worker: neewoody-dispatch-api
- KV namespace: neewoody-dispatch
- API key: nwd-dispatch-2024
- Allowed KV keys: nwd-crew, nwd-tools, nwd-jobs, nwd-damage, nwd-quotes, nwd-overhead, nwd-leads, nwd-config
- Worker route: neewoodygh.com/api/*
- VAPID public key is in dispatch.html — private key is in the Worker — never replace these without forcing all crew to re-subscribe

**Push notifications:**
- Browser dispatch uses Web Push (VAPID)
- Native Android app uses Expo push tokens (stored as expo-{crewId} in KV)
- Worker sends to both channels simultaneously
- Admin push subscription stored as sub-cr01

**Workshop GPS:** 5.56108374374371, -0.21373364856801483 (Amugi Ave, Accra)
Geofence radius: 100m (adjustable in admin settings)

### Dispatch Job Lifecycle
Briefed → Pre-departure (checklist locked, items packed) → Departed (GPS gated at workshop) → En route → On site (GPS gated at site) → Return check (all tools accounted for) → Closed

**Crew roles:**
- Admin (Nuer) — full access, all jobs
- Supervisor (Kevin) — assigned jobs, can oversee two simultaneous jobs
- Lead Apprentice — becomes field supervisor on split-crew jobs
- Work Hand / Trainee — crew view only

**Split crew:** Two jobs can run simultaneously. Lead apprentice is field supervisor on Job B, still reports to Kevin.

### Quote Reference System
Quotes saved to KV as nwd-quotes
Reference format: NWD-001, NWD-002 etc.
Statuses: Draft → Sent → Accepted → Declined
Actual costs tab tracks real expenditure against quoted costs — admin only, crew never see it
Net profit projection defaults: 15% income tax, 20% idle time reserve

### Site Key Conventions

- Brand colours: --clr-accent #A0784A (timber gold), --clr-bg #F7F4EF (parchment), --clr-dark #1C1A17
- Fonts: Playfair Display (headings) + DM Sans (body)
- Instagram token: set as IG_TOKEN in Cloudflare Pages dashboard (expires every 60 days — refresh required)
- Contact form: POSTs to /api/lead (Worker saves to KV, sends push to admin)
- Analytics: GA4 (G-ZP77WR6BNH) + Cloudflare Web Analytics (automatic)
